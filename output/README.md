# Output Directory

This directory contains generated results from the simulations (informative and non-informative censoring scenarios). Files are CSVs with columns: pt (threshold), NB_km, NB_ipcw, NB_true, bias_km, bias_ipcw.

- `informative_results.csv`: Replication results for informative censoring.
- `non_informative_results.csv`: Replication results for non-informative censoring.

These can be loaded for quick analysis without re-running simulations.
